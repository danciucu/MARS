Site engineers are using a tool called EDM (electric distance measurement) that allows them to take measurements. Generally, when masonry arch are analyzed, the shape of the arch will be captured by the site engineer with the EDM. A .dxf file will be generated with the points measured on side and the CAD engineers are using it to draw the profile of the arch. This process is very long and it doesn't have a scientific approach in order to allow the CAD engineer to control the errors and have a desirable shape based on the site measurements. Masonry Arch Assessment Software (MARS) allows the user to insert a set of points and it draws automatically the shape of the arch in AutoCAD based on a polynomial.
