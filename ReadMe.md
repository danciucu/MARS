# MARS

Site engineers are using a tool called EDM (electric distance measurement) that allows them to take measurements. Those points taken are converted to a .dwg file and it makes it hard to draw an accurate shape of the arch if some points are missing or they are measured badly.
MARS it allows the user to insert a set of points and it draws automatically the shape of the arch in AutoCAD.
